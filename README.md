This Module Requires Custom System Builder! This is designed specifically for Custom System Builder and will not function without it.

Quick Planet & Alien Generation: Several roll tables are included, allowing you to generate planetary details and alien species instantly or step-by-step:

Use One Click Planet and Alien Creation to roll for everything at once.
Also included are Trooper Names, Trooper Reputation, Strength Flashbacks, and Weakness Flashbacks

Scenes: Besides the scenes for the Hokusai Campaign, there is also an all purpose Battle Mat that you can use for any encounter you want to run.

Tokens: There are 7 different color coded tokens for players to choose from.

Rollable Sheets: Several things on character sheets are rollable: Name, Serial Number, Reputation, Flashbacks, and Fighting and Non-Fighting Ability. Clicking the word "Kills" adds "Kills on Mission" to "Total Kills"

Ranks, Gear, and Weapons: All items are stored in the Item Directory and can be dragged and dropped onto character sheets.

Creating Aliens:
When adding a new alien, create a new Actor and select the alien_Template as the base.
20 unique red icons are included for Alien Body Forms.

Important Editing Warning: Unless you're experienced with Custom System Builder, do not modify any sheet that includes "_Template" in its name. These are essential for proper system functionality.
